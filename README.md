This compose file of docker helps us to create  a hadoop cluster of a Namenode, two datatnodes and a YARN master.
To run the compose file in your system to set up similar cluster , you need to con this compose file as "docker-compose up -d"
For checking the details of the cluster formed use the URL:"http://docker-host-ip:8088" , where docker-host-ip must be replaced by the IP of the system over which we are using our docker.
